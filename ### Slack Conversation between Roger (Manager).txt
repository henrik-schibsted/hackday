Good morning, Håkan! How's everything coming along with the new project?

---

**Håkan**  
*2023-10-17 09:05 AM*  
Morning Roger! Everything is mostly on track. I'm working on the frontend right now. There are a few bugs, but nothing I can't handle.

**Roger**  
*2023-10-17 09:08 AM*  
Great to hear! Have you had a chance to sync up with Alice from the design team? She had some changes she wanted to discuss.

---

**Håkan**  
*2023-10-17 09:11 AM*  
Ah, no, not yet. I was planning to reach out to her this afternoon. Do you think it's urgent?

---

**Roger**  
*2023-10-17 09:14 AM*  
It might be a good idea to touch base sooner. She mentioned some last-minute alterations, and it's better to incorporate those before you go too far down the current path.

---

**Håkan**  
*2023-10-17 09:17 AM*  
Got it. I'll reach out to her as soon as we're done chatting here. Anything else I should be aware of?

---

**Roger**  
*2023-10-17 09:21 AM*  
Well, there's been talk of accelerating the project timeline. The client is really excited and wants to launch earlier. What are your thoughts on that?

---

**Håkan**  
*2023-10-17 09:24 AM*  
Hmm, that's a bit of a curveball. Do we have enough resources to expedite the project?

---

**Roger**  
*2023-10-17 09:28 AM*  
I think we can manage if we reallocate some resources from another project that's wrapping up. It would mean longer hours for a bit, though.

---

**Håkan**  
*2023-10-17 09:31 AM*  
Well, if the team is up for it, I don't see why not. But I'd like to discuss it with everyone first.

---

**Roger**  
*2023-10-17 09:35 AM*  
Absolutely, that's a good idea. Why don't you call for a quick team meeting after you talk to Alice?

---

**Håkan**  
*2023-10-17 09:37 AM*  
Will do. Anything else on your mind?

---

**Roger**  
*2023-10-17 09:40 AM*  
Yes, actually. We've got the annual reviews coming up soon. Do you have any concerns or points you'd like to discuss in yours?

---

**Håkan**  
*2023-10-17 09:43 AM*  
Oh right, the reviews. I've been so engrossed in the project that I haven't given it much thought. But I'll put something together.

---

**Roger**  
*2023-10-17 09:46 AM*  
Great. Make sure you highlight your accomplishments; it's easy to forget them in the day-to-day rush.

---

**Håkan**  
*2023-10-17 09:49 AM*  
I'll make sure to do that. Thanks for the reminder.

---

**Roger**  
*2023-10-17 09:52 AM*  
You're welcome. Let's aim to touch base later in the week to see how everything is progressing. Sound good?

---

**Håkan**  
*2023-10-17 09:55 AM*  
Sounds like a plan. I'll schedule that in.

---

**Roger**  
*2023-10-17 09:57 AM*  
Excellent! Good luck with Alice and the team meeting. Let me know how it goes.

---

**Håkan**  
*2023-10-17 10:00 AM*  
Will do. Have a great day, Roger!

---

**Roger**  
*2023-10-17 10:02 AM*  
You too, Håkan. Take care!
